HTML Structure:

The HTML structure includes the basic elements: <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <meta>, <title>, <style>, <body>, and <script>.
A simple header with a dark background and white text is created using the <header> tag.

CSS Styling:

Basic styling is applied to the body, providing a background color and removing margins and padding.
The header has a dark background color, white text, and centered alignment.

getCartItems Function:

This function retrieves the cart items from local storage. If no items are found, it returns an empty array.

Inline Event Handling (onclick Attribute):

The "Remove" button for each item has an onclick attribute that calls the removeFromCart function with the item's ID.

LocalStorage Usage:

The localStorage object is used to store and retrieve cart items. The cart items are stored as a JSON string.

Redirection to Cart Page:

When a user clicks the "Add to Cart" button on the product details page, the addToCartAndRedirect function is triggered.
This function adds the selected product to the cart, updates the cart items in local storage, and redirects the user to the cart page (cart.html) after a short delay.

Additional Notes:

This is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, you would likely use more sophisticated data management, possibly involving a backend server.
The code uses a simple delay (setTimeout) before redirection to ensure that the cart is updated before navigating to the cart page
